        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I have always loved to learn different things. I started swimming at a very early age and was on an organization in my town from age 8 up till my 1st year of high school. I then joined the swim team there.</p>
          <p>Also at a young age I learned to bowl. I joined the bowling team my 1st year of high school also. These were my main hobbies along with reading. I love, love to read. I would say my favorites to read are drama thrillers. What a lot of people do not know is that when I was younger I read all our encyclopedias(for those of you too young these were books that were alphebetical and had all kinds of dfferent subjects to read). I have a lot of different hobbies and interests.</p>
