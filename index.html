        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am learning to become a web developer/designer. This is a huge career change for me. I started this journey after learning I could no longer perform the physical demands of work I had done all my life. I was a true blue collar worker. I am a bit older but it is never to late to learn something new. My fiancè got me interested in web development after seeing my love of Googleling (is that a word?! lol) anything and everything. He also saw that I am very analytical and a perfectionist.
        </p>
        <p>As I said I loved my blue collar jobs. From the ages of 16 through 19 I worked in the fast food industry. I started out as a cashier and worked up to assistant manager. Then ages 19 through 33 I was a dental and orthodontic assistant. In December of 2000 I had a miracle baby as I was not supposed to be able to have children. Boy was that a shock!
        </p>
        <p>I became a stay at home mom taking care of my daughter up until 2013 when I got hit with a divorce. Now being out of the work force for 13 years and being much older it was very hard to get back into the work force. I tried going back to the fast food industry but times had changed and it was not for me anymore. Then I got a job with UPS. I loved it but my body didn't. At age 48 it was too much on my body so I had to quit. Now I was in a quandary about what to do. I met my fiancè and he helped me investigate what I could do to become a web developer and I finally landed at Treehouse for my education.
